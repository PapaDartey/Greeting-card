## Discussion
I learnt how Vite improves development speed with its faster build process.I practiced breaking down the UI into reusable components (Header, GreetingCard) to maintain a clean and modular structure.I used utility classes to quickly style components without writing custom CSS from scratch.

## Challenges faced
- Initial unfamiliarity with Vite required watching tutorials to understand its setup process.
- Deciding on the component structure to ensure reusability and scalability.
- Tailwind’s syntax took some getting used to but became intuitive with practice.
